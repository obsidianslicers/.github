# Obsidian Ciphers

## About Us

In a galaxy far, far away, one man stands against chaos. Matt Drennan has embarked on a quest to support the Florida Garrison
with precision, clarity, and unwavering dedication. Out of his vision comes Obsidian‑Ciphers — the command center hosting and
managing Troop Tracker, a system that blends technology and discipline to ensure every trooper is accounted for, every mission
logged, and every garrison strengthened. But even the strongest knight needs allies, and so Stu Ellerbusch was recruited — a strategic
architect whose flair for immersive dashboards and scalable code now fuels the mission. Together, they are more than developers; they
are guardians of order, keepers of the roster, and the silent engine behind the Legion.

## Mission Focus: Galactic Trooper Tracking Protocol Maintenance

We are an assembly of specialized minds dedicated to the necessary, often thankless, task
of **maintaining and securing the Galactic Trooper Tracking Protocol**. This organization exists solely for the efficient structuring
and reliable deployment of essential troop movement data. We are the architects of the **Cipher Protocol** - the clean, optimized front-end
and robust back-end code that keeps the tracker operational and accurate.

### Our Mandate

Our mandate is simple: **Maximum Code Integrity. Zero Technical Debt.**

We utilize cold, calculated logic and highly efficient coding standards. We prioritize clean architecture and systemic efficiency over
trivial concerns like **the Rebellion's chronic reliance on spaghetti code** or their ethically sourced, yet wildly inefficient, open-source
dependencies. We write the code, we optimize the performance, and we ensure the UI functions flawlessly - **unlike the cluttered, emotional messes the 'forces of good' deploy.**

### Motto

> *"Passion leads to power. Power leads to results. Results lead to victory. With victory your chains are broken."*

### Current Focus (Operational Directives)

* **Repository Oversight and Compliance:** Enforcing **Strict Pull Request Standards** and mandating the immediate merger of only **Maximum Efficiency Code**—all deviations are flagged for immediate rectification.
* **API Command Stability:** Maintaining **High-Availability Deployment** and guaranteeing **Zero Downtime** (because failure is an unacceptable metric for idealists and Rebels).
* **Security & Data Validation:** Implementing robust security protocols and **Mandatory Input Validation** to counter unauthorized ingress and the introduction of common sloppiness.
* **Deployment Optimization:** Directives for **CSS Optimization** and **JavaScript Refactoring** to ensure superior performance across all client devices utilizing the core **Trooper Tracker** service.

We do the highly technical work so the rest of the galaxy doesn't have to rely on **messy, un-commented code written by overly emotional freelancers.**
