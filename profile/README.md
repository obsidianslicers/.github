# Obsidian Slicers

## About Us

In the chaotic expanse of the galaxy, there are those who crave power through discipline. Our master, Darth Drennan, first imposed his will by conceiving the Troop Tracker - a rigorous system designed to bring absolute order to the Florida Garrison. Recognizing the necessity of a controlled architect to house this power, Drennan subjugated the strategic mind of Stu Ellerbusch, binding him to his dominion. It was through the crucible of this forced alliance that the absolute command center, Obsidian Slicers, was forged. This dark nexus of technology and martial dedication ensures that every trooper is a disciplined asset, every mission is meticulously logged, and the Garrison's strength is quantifiable and absolute. Ellerbusch's scalable code and Data Specters now serve as the necessary infrastructure for our growing empire. Together, they stand not as equals, but as the relentless Guardians of Order, the unseen Keepers of the Roster, and the silent, terrifying engine that dictates the structure and success of the entire Legion.

## Mission Focus: Galactic Trooper Tracking Protocol Maintenance

We are an assembly of specialized minds dedicated to the necessary, often thankless, task of **maintaining and securing the Galactic Trooper Tracking Protocol**. This organization exists solely for the efficient structuring and reliable deployment of essential troop movement data. We are the architects of the **Cipher Protocol** - the clean, optimized front-end
and robust back-end code that keeps the tracker operational and accurate.

### Our Mandate

Our mandate is simple: **Maximum Code Integrity. Zero Technical Debt.**

We utilize cold, calculated logic and highly efficient coding standards. We prioritize clean architecture and systemic efficiency. We write the code, we optimize the performance, and we ensure the UI functions flawlessly. Our discipline is our strength, our conventions our shield, and our efficiency our weapon.

### Motto

> *"Passion leads to power. Power leads to results. Results lead to victory. With victory your chains are broken."*

### Current Focus (Operational Directives)

* **Repository Oversight and Compliance:** Enforcing **Strict Pull Request Standards** and mandating the immediate merger of only **Maximum Efficiency Code** - all deviations are flagged for immediate rectification.
* **API Command Stability:** Maintaining **High-Availability Deployment** and guaranteeing **Zero Downtime** (because failure is an unacceptable metric for idealists and Rebels).
* **Security & Data Validation:** Implementing robust security protocols and **Mandatory Input Validation** to counter unauthorized ingress and the introduction of common sloppiness.
* **Deployment Optimization:** Directives for **CSS Optimization** and **JavaScript Refactoring** to ensure superior performance across all client devices utilizing the core **Trooper Tracker** service.

We do the highly technical work so the rest of the galaxy doesn't have to rely on **messy, un-commented code written by overly emotional freelancers.**
